# plugin-freshness.sh — is the skill text THIS SESSION is serving the current one?
#
#   plugin-freshness.sh [<skill-or-plugin-dir>] [--quiet] [--json]
#
# Defaults to $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, which Claude Code sets to the plugin root of the skill
# being run — so a skill calls it with no arguments.
#
# A COPY. The canonical file is claude-skills-public `scripts/plugin-freshness.sh`, which the
# plugins in that repo reach through the marketplace clone. refdiff is its own repo and is also
# installed dev and vendored, where no marketplace clone exists — so it carries its own, and
# `preflight.sh` calls THIS one. Change the canonical first, then copy it across; the two are
# byte-identical apart from this paragraph.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and why check-drift.sh does not cover it.
#
# check-drift.sh compares the INSTALL RECORD against the marketplace CATALOG: "is what is
# installed behind what is published". That is one of three versions in play, and it is blind
# to the one that actually bites.
#
#   catalog    what the marketplace publishes
#   installed  what `claude plugin update` last wrote into the install record
#   loaded     the cache directory THIS SESSION resolved when it first loaded the skill
#
# `loaded` is pinned at session start and never moves again. The cache keeps every version
# side by side (nine directories for one plugin, measured), so a long session goes on serving
# the text it booted with while an update writes a new directory beside it and the record
# points at that one instead. Nothing reports this: the update prints success, check-drift
# prints "current", and the session keeps reading the old file.
#
# Measured 2026-09-25: a session served refdiff 1.4.0 for its entire length while the install
# records read 1.6.0 and 1.6.1. The two rules that session most needed — a comp's frames FORK,
# and re-run every pair after a shared-component fix — landed in 1.6.1 and were absent from
# the 1.4.0 text it was reading. It followed them only because a human had restated them in a
# handoff. The tell was one line nobody looks at: the "Base directory for this skill" the Skill
# tool prints on invocation.
#
# Exit: 0 = current · 3 = ask the user (a version is behind) · 2 = could not determine.
# 3 rather than 1 on purpose: the skill still MEASURES correctly, it may simply not know a
# newer rule, so "carry on" stays a legitimate answer and the only thing ruled out is settling
# it silently. That is the same contract refdiff's preflight uses for `action = ask`.
#
# 2 IS NOT A PASS and a caller must not treat it as one. It means this run could not answer —
# the record was absent, malformed, or named no version for this plugin — so the session may be
# serving stale text and nobody knows. Until 2026-09-26 every one of those inputs printed
# "CURRENT" and exited 0 instead, which is the same silence-reads-as-clean failure the script
# was written to catch, inside the script itself. Both are now distinguishable, both are tested.
